## Common Issues to Flag:

1. **Performance Issues**:
```dart
// Bad: Rebuilds entire widget tree
Provider.of<MyProvider>(context).someValue

// Good: Only rebuilds when specific value changes
context.select<MyProvider, ValueType>((p) => p.someValue)
```

2. **Memory Leaks**:
```dart
// Bad: Controller not disposed
class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  final controller = TextEditingController();
}

// Good: Proper disposal
@override
void dispose() {
  controller.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

3. **Widget Keys**:
- Flag missing keys in dynamic lists
- Flag incorrect key usage

## Review Commands:
- Run analysis: `flutter analyze`
- Check formatting: `flutter format . --set-exit-if-changed`

## Review Output Format:
Provide feedback in this structure:
1. **Summary**: Overall code quality assessment
