## Review

### Summary of Changes Made

All requested Claude Code features have been successfully implemented:

1. **Documentation Update Slash Command** (`.claude/commands/update-docs.md`)
   - Created a command that analyzes the codebase and updates README.md and CLAUDE.md
   - Can be invoked with `/update-docs` 
   - Optionally accepts arguments to focus on specific components

2. **Flutter-Specific Subagents** (`.claude/agents/`)
   - **flutter-ui**: UI/UX specialist for Material Design and responsive layouts
   - **flutter-state**: Provider pattern expert for state management
   - **flutter-test**: Testing specialist for unit, widget, and integration tests
   - **flutter-platform**: Platform-specific code expert for iOS, Android, Web, and desktop
   - **code-reviewer**: Senior reviewer for code quality and best practices

3. **Auto-Commit Hook** (`.claude/hooks.json`)
   - Triggers after Write/Edit/MultiEdit operations
   - Runs `flutter analyze` to check for issues
   - Only commits if analysis passes and there are changes
   - Uses descriptive commit messages with file information

### How to Use

1. **Update Documentation**: Run `/update-docs` or `/update-docs [component]`
2. **Use Subagents**: Claude will automatically delegate or you can request: "Use the flutter-ui agent to improve the search screen"
3. **Auto-Commit**: Works automatically - edits trigger analysis and commit if successful

### Implementation Notes
- All changes were kept minimal and focused
- No existing code was modified
- Created simple, single-purpose components
- Followed Claude Code best practices for commands, agents, and hooks
